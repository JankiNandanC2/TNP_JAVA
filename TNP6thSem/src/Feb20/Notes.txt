Why we don't have to import java lang package ?
                           ---- >  har class extend karta hai Object ko by default
                           ----->  sabhi class ka by defualt " Object class " Parent hota hai
                           class A extends Object{}
                           class B extends A{}

                           object
                             |
                             A          > this is multilevel Inheritance not multiple inheritance

                  POLYMORPHISM
--> one name many forms
 --> two types :- 1 compile time / static / achieved using method overloading
                        -> inheritance not required for method overloading
                        -> cannot create a method with same name and same parameter
                        --> no of parameter should be different or type of parameter should be different
                        -> call of method is decided at compile time
                        -> private method cannot be called by other class as private method is visible to same class or inherited clas

                  2 run  time / dynamic / achieved using method overriding
                        -> inheritance required
